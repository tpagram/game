## Build Setup

Yo fellas.
When developing, run the following:

In one terminal, `npm run dev`. This is the Vue server, running on port 8080. Go to `localhost:8080` to access it.
In the other, `npm run api`. This is our api server for our sockets, on port 3000.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test

# deploy
npm run deploy
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
