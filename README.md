## Build Setup

A vue app with socket.io.

To run locally:
In one terminal, `npm run dev`. This is the Vue server, running on port 8080. Go to `localhost:8080` to access it.
In the other, `npm run api`. This is our api server for our sockets, on port 3000.

To deploy, run `npm run build` to build the `dist` folder and `npm run deploy` to deploy it production.
