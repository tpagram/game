## Build Setup

A Vue app with socket.io.

To run locally, run the following:

1) `npm run dev`. This is the Vue server, running on port 8080. Go to `localhost:8080` to access it.
2) `npm run api`. This is the API server with socket.io, on port 3000.

To deploy, run `npm run build` to build the `dist` folder and `npm run deploy` to deploy it production.
